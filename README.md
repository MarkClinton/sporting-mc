## About
Sporting M.C. is a website for a fictional football club. The name "Sporting M.C." is a mix of the term "Sporting" which refers to a sporting club and is widely used in naming teams in the Portugese League. As football grows in the USA some clubs are adopting the moniker "Sporting". M.C. are my initials. Putting them both together gave birth to the idea "Sporting M.C."

The aim of the website is so supporters of the club can keep up to date with club news, view upcoming fixtures and results results of previous matches and allows you to sign up and become a member of the club. The fictional club Sporting M.C. take part in the Primeira Liga, Portugal's top flight division. 

## Design
The website is intended to be colorful in its design and full of content related to the team. 

- ### Colour Scheme 
The two main colors of the site (#000080, #ffc300) provide a complementary color harmony as they directly oppose each other on the RGB color wheel. I also just happen to like both yellow and blue when used together.  

- ### Imagery
The hero image was chosen as a reflection of all the fans who support the club by showing a packed stadium. The background images were chosen to keep on theme of the site. Football centric imagery. Because the team is based in Portugal and competes in the Primeira Liga, real teams such as Sporting CP, FC Porto appear on the Fixtures & Results page for a sense of realism. 

- ### Typography 
Google font was used to pick 2 comnplimentary fonts. Roboto and Rubik are the fonts used. Rubik used for H elements. Roboto used for P elements.

- ### Wireframes
The site was initially designed using Balsamiq. [Link to the Wireframes PDF](documentation/wireframes/Portfolio%201%20Wireframes.pdf)

## Target Audience
The intended audience for this site are football fans. More specifically fans of Sporting M.C. Visitors to the site will want to know whats happening with the club, latest news, latest results, upcoming fixtures. The intent is to have everything available to fans that they need to keep up to date with the club.

- ### Helpful Links

  - [Stack Overflow Post on Flexbox](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39644585/using-flex-order-property-to-re-arrange-items-for-desktop-and-mobile-views): This Stack Overflow article helped me with fixing my flexbox issue for my middle article positioning. The intent was to have the article viewable like the one above it when on mobile but when the screen was for desktop that the image be on the left and the article header and content be contained on the right. [Link to code](https://github.com/MarkClinton/sporting-mc/blob/e5fe8238415a538ee9f5f4d5991509932f0bfa3a/news.html#L84).
  - [Stack Overflow Post on Text outline](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11323813/how-to-outline-text-in-html-css): Because one of my nav items was larger than the others I couldnt assign it an accurate width without messing up the rest of the nav spacing. This would cause a slight movement if I used font-bold on hover. Instead, I used text shadow to acheive some sort of bold text. 
  - [Stack Overflow Post on styling Radio Buttons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37069238/how-to-change-the-font-style-in-radio-button): I wanted a custom style for my radio buttons to fit the theme of the site. Using this Stack Overflow post I was able to do it. 


## Issues
- The GitHub repository contains a file called .DS_Store. This file is not needed and should have been added to my .gitignore file.
